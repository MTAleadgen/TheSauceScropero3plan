# Project Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Updated Docker Configs**
   * Added `DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` and `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD` to `docker-compose.yml`
   * Environment variables configured for Airflow services

2. **Implemented GPU Automation**
   * Created Lambda automation scripts for managing A10 GPU instances
   * Added SSH key setup and configuration
   * Implemented retry logic for API connections
   * Created setup script for Lambda GPU environment

3. **SERP Processing Logic**
   * Updated `services/discovery/discovery.py` with comprehensive search query
   * Added DataForSEO API integration
   * Added metrics for API usage monitoring

4. **LLM Integration Preparation**
   * Created SERP parsing scripts using Qwen-3 LLM
